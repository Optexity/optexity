title: Sleep Action
description: Insert pure wait steps into your automations
---

The `sleep_action` lets you pause execution without performing any browser interaction.

## Overview

- **Use when**: You want a fixed delay that doesn't depend on page load or element state.
- **Execution**: The runner simply waits for the specified duration, then proceeds to the next node.

## Properties

| Property     | Type    | Description                          |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `sleep_time` | `float` | Duration to sleep, in seconds        |

## JSON Example

```json
{
  "type": "action_node",
  "sleep_action": {
    "sleep_time": 5.0
  }
}
```

## When to Use `sleep_action` vs `end_sleep_time`

Use `sleep_action` when you want a **standalone timing node** in your flow (for example, to wait between two unrelated actions).

Use `end_sleep_time` on an existing node when you just need a short buffer **after** a specific action runs.
